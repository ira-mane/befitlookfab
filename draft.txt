Certainly! Let's break down your requirements:

1. **Form in React without a Backend:**
   - If you want to collect form data without setting up a backend, you can use **Zapier**. Here's how:
     - Create a form in React using hooks (you can use functional components).
     - Add input fields (don't forget the labels for accessibility and SEO).
     - Obtain a Zapier webhook URL by creating a Zap (integration) that catches data from the webhook.
     - Hardcode the webhook URL into your form's action attribute.
     - When users submit the form, it will post data to the Zapier URL, which can then connect to various data sources¹.

   - Alternatively, you can use **Google Sheets** as a simple "database":
     - Collect form data in React.
     - Use the Google Sheets API to write data directly to a Google Sheet.
     - This approach doesn't require a backend server but does involve setting up Google Sheets API access.

2. **Blog Page:**
   - For a blog page, you can create static content using React components.
   - Consider using a markdown-to-HTML library (like `react-markdown`) to render blog posts from markdown files.
   - Store your blog posts as markdown files in your project (no backend needed).

3. **CMS Options:**
   - While React itself doesn't provide a built-in CMS, you can integrate third-party CMS solutions:
     - **Contentful**: A headless CMS that allows you to manage content and retrieve it via APIs.
     - **Netlify CMS**: A Git-based CMS that integrates well with static site generators like Gatsby or Next.js.
     - **Strapi**: A self-hosted CMS with a RESTful API or GraphQL endpoints.
     - **Prismic**: Another headless CMS with a visual editor and API access.
